Overview of what Morse code is?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: dots (or dits) and dashes (or dahs). It’s named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy. Here are some key points:
Representation: Morse code represents letters, numerals, and punctuation marks using dots and dashes.
Transmission: It’s transmitted as electrical pulses (e.g., via telegraph) or analogous mechanical/visual signals (like flashing lights).
Efficiency: The duration of each symbol is inversely proportional to the character’s frequency in English text.
Human Interpretation: Morse code can be directly interpreted by trained individuals through sound waves, visible light, or other senses.

Historical context of why Morse code was created?
 Morse Code was invented by Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s as a means of transmitting messages via telegraph wires. Its simplicity and reliability made it the go-to method for long-distance communication during the 19th and 20th centuries12. Before its development, communication over extended distances could have been much smoother. The code sought to distill language into a series of dots and dashes, making it feasible for swift electronic transmission.

Explanation of how Morse code system works, including dots and dashes.
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: dots (or dits) and dashes (or dahs). Here’s how it works:

Symbols: Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. A dit represents a short signal, while a dah represents a longer signal. The duration of a dah is three times that of a dit.
Spaces: Within an encoded character, each dit or dah is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space. The space duration equals the dit duration. Letters within a word are separated by a space equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.
Transmission: Morse code can be transmitted via sound waves, visible light, or other mediums. For example, a telegraph machine or flashlight can create the dots and dashes, which the receiver then decodes into letters and numbers using a chart or by listening to the signals12.
Efficiency: Morse code was designed so that the duration of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character it represents in English text. Thus, common letters like ‘E’ have shorter codes (a single dit), optimizing transmission efficiency.
