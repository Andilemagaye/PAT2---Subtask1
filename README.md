## Overview of what Morse code is?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: dots (or dits) and dashes (or dahs). It’s named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy. Here are some key points:
Representation: Morse code represents letters, numerals, and punctuation marks using dots and dashes.
Transmission: It’s transmitted as electrical pulses (e.g., via telegraph) or analogous mechanical/visual signals (like flashing lights).
Efficiency: The duration of each symbol is inversely proportional to the character’s frequency in English text.
Human Interpretation: Morse code can be directly interpreted by trained individuals through sound waves, visible light, or other senses.

## Historical context of why Morse code was used?
 Morse Code was invented by Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s as a means of transmitting messages via telegraph wires. Its simplicity and reliability made it the go-to method for long-distance communication during the 19th and 20th centuries12. Before its development, communication over extended distances could have been much smoother. The code sought to distill language into a series of dots and dashes, making it feasible for swift electronic transmission.

## Explanation of how Morse code system works?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: dots (also known as dits) and dashes (or dahs). Here’s how it works:

Dits and Dahs:
Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs.
A dit represents a short signal, while a dah represents a longer signal.
The duration of a dah is three times that of a dit.
For clarity, telegraphers may exaggerate the length of a dah.
Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence (a space), equal to the dit duration.
Word and Letter Separation:
Letters within a word are separated by a space equal to three dits.
Words themselves are separated by a space equal to seven dits.
Transmission Medium:
Morse code can be transmitted via various media: electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves.
The medium is present during the dit or dah and absent between them.
Memorization and Interpretation:
Morse code can be memorized and sent in a form perceptible to human senses (e.g., sound waves or visible light).
Trained individuals can directly interpret Morse code.
There’s no distinction between upper and lower case letters.
Efficiency:
To increase transmission efficiency, Morse code assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters.
For example, the letter ‘E’ has the shortest code—a single dit.
Remember, Morse code was originally developed for telegraphy and remains an intriguing historical communication system!
