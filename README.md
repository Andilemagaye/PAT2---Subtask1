Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: dots (or dits) and dashes (or dahs). It’s named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy. Here are some key points:
Representation: Morse code represents letters, numerals, and punctuation marks using dots and dashes.
Transmission: It’s transmitted as electrical pulses (e.g., via telegraph) or analogous mechanical/visual signals (like flashing lights).
Efficiency: The duration of each symbol is inversely proportional to the character’s frequency in English text.
Human Interpretation: Morse code can be directly interpreted by trained individuals through sound waves, visible light, or other senses.

 Morse Code was invented by Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s as a means of transmitting messages via telegraph wires. Its simplicity and reliability made it the go-to method for long-distance communication during the 19th and 20th centuries12. Before its development, communication over extended distances could have been much smoother. The code sought to distill language into a series of dots and dashes, making it feasible for swift electronic transmission.
